https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases/download/v5.4.0/clingo-5.4.0-win64.zip


2. Extract Compressed Folders in "clingo-5.3.0-win64.zip" to your preferred path, e.g.,
```
C:\Users\zyang90\Downloads\
```

## Hello World Example
Consider a Clingo program 
```
1{p(1..6)}.
```
which says that "p(1), p(2), ..., p(6) are possibly true AND at least one of them is true". Depending on your OS, you can follow the steps below to use Clingo to find all (or a specific number of) its stable models. 

### Linux or Mac OS
1. Save the Clingo program in a file, say "test.txt", in a folder and remember the path to this file. Say the path is as follows.
```
~\Downloads\test.txt
```
2. Open a terminal.
3. Execute the following command line to get all stable models of this Clingo program.
```
clingo ~\Downloads\test.txt 0
```
In the above command, 0 means that we require Clingo to output all stable models. If you don't put this 0, by default, Clingo will only output one stable model and terminate. You can also set this number to, say, 3 to let Clingo to output 3 stable models (if there exist) and then terminate.
### Windows
Suppose the path to the Clingo package is as follows. 
```
C:\Users\zyang90\Downloads\clingo-5.4.0-win64
```
You may use the following steps to execute Clingo on the example program.
1. Save the Clingo program in a file, say "test.txt", in the Clingo package folder. The path to the file "test.txt" is as follows.
```
C:\Users\zyang90\Downloads\clingo-5.4.0-win64\test.txt
```
2. Open a "Command Prompt".
3. cd to the Clingo folder. 
```
cd C:\Users\zyang90\Downloads\clingo-5.4.0-win64
```
4. Execute the following command line to get all stable models of this Clingo program.
```
clingo.exe test.txt 0
```
In the above command, 0 means that we require Clingo to output all stable models. If you don't put this 0, by default, Clingo will only output one stable model and terminate. You can also set this number to, say, 3 to let Clingo to output 3 stable models (if there exist) and then terminate.
